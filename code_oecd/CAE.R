##### Data preparation #####
# The objects of preparation.R should be defined, including the dataframes containing the survey data.
# The functions from .Rprofile, heterogeneity_graph.R and render.R should be defined.
update_constant(fr) # To restrict the data to FR and defines constant for FR analysis. 
# update_constant(all) may be needed at the beginning of international comparisons. Such "international" sections should be then followed by update_constant(fr).
