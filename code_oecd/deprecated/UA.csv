To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget.

Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 40 cents per gallon in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $30/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2/day out of extreme poverty. Most Americans would lose out financially as they would face price increases in excess of $30/month.

Підвищення температури збільшило ризик повеней у деяких місцях, поставило під загрозу життя мільйонів людей уздовж водних артерій і негативно впливає на розмноження рослин і тварин. Гадаю, що слід скоротити використання викопного палива, як-от нафта, вуглець та природний газ, і замінити їх на відновлювані та екологічно чисті джерела енергії, збільшуючи при цьому енергоефективність.

Учить их объединяться, чтобы добиваться своих целей. Акции протеста, по-моему, неэффективны. Они имитируют деятельность, создают у людей ложное убеждение, что они в чём-то участвуют, а по сути, просто поговорили и разошлись. Законов, позволяющих защитить окружающую среду, в Украине принято достаточно, их, как всегда, просто не исполняют. Нужно активное участие в первую очередь молодёжи в контроле исполнения этих законов (старшее поколение просто не поймёт нужности всего этого). 
То есть, по-моему, нужно сейчас просто наладить контроль за соблюдением законодательства, причем контроль этот - со стороны общественных организаций. Реальный контроль, со включением правовых механизмов, иначе всё останется только на этапе фиксации нарушений. А должны быть вполне конкретные  санкции за нарушения. Со стороны государства такой контроль неэффективен, т.к. сразу же появляется коррупция.
