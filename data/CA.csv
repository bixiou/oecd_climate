To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget. Each country could aim to emit less than a share of the carbon budget. To respect the global carbon budget, countries that emit more than their national share would pay a fee to countries that emit less than their share.
Do you support such a policy?","Suppose the above policy is in place.

Each adult across the world would have one vote to elect members of the assembly.,"Imagine the following policy: a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions funding a global basic income.


Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 14 cents per liter in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of CA$38/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than CA$2.5/day out of extreme poverty. 
The average Canadian person would lose out a bit from this policy as they would face CA$133 per month in price increases, which is higher than the CA$38 they would receive.
