donation,donation,"donation: By taking this survey, you are automatically entered into a lottery to win [$100]. In a few days you will know whether you have been selected in the lottery. The payment will be made to you in the same way as your compensation for this survey, so no further action is required on your part. 

  
You can also donate a part of this additional compensation (should you be selected in the lottery) to a reforestation project through the charity The Gold Standard. This charity has already proven effective to reduce 151 million tons of CO2 to fight climate change and has been carefully selected by our team. The Gold Standard is highly transparent and ensures that its projects feature the highest levels of environmental integrity and contribute to sustainable development. 

 
  Should you win the lottery, please enter your donation amount using the slider below: - Donation amount (in % of max)"
