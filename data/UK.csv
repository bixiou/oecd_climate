To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget.

Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 40 cents per gallon in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $30/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2/day out of extreme poverty. Most Americans would lose out financially as they would face price increases in excess of $30/month.

We really need to reduce the population by 75%. War and pestilence used to do that for us but even the worldwide COVID-19 has done little is that respect. It would be a lot less distressful and painful if we reduced the population in a controlled humane way however if we do nothing then it will eventually sort itself out as the population starves from lack of food or freezes due to lack of combustible material to generate heat.

1) Voluntarism can make a meaningful contribution to CO2-reduction and would be fair.

2) CO2 emitted by beef production is the same as CO2 emitted  by the burning of fossil fuels. In fact, every CO2 molecule emitted by a cow has in the previous 1 or 2 years been extracted from the atmosphere by the plants the cow has been eating. That is just a natural CO2 cycle. CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuels however has not been in the atmosphere for millions of years.

All of these factors are intertwined.

The UK government, unfortunately, appears to put more emphasis on saying that they are doing the right thing than then driving forwards effective initiatives. They seems unwilling to lay it on the line that the public will have to make changes in lifestyle and readjustments to their expectations when it comes to non-essential behaviour and purchasing. Similarly it seems unwilling to stand up to the lobbyists for large companies and industrial groups - which may or may not be significant party donors - and to demand that they make radical changes to their operations, which may include stopping the never ending propaganda to consume and to conform to wasteful behaviour.

So, to turn the previous paragraph into action, I would suggest that the UK government needs to start by being honest, both with the public and with business. It should try to avoid doing this in a confrontational fashion and it should not be scare-mongering - at least not more than is required to get through people's complacency.

This is calling for very subtle and assured communications which governments do not always have (I am not singling out the current UK government because these seem to have been recurrent failings during my lifetime though the UK governement's HIV advertising in the 1980s, while criticised at the time, has come to be held in higher regard as effectively expressing the virus's danger.)

This communication should also move from the dangers to expressing the positives; eg cutting down on unncecessary car travel might seem like a major sacrifice to many people but by emphasising that going to the countryside from fresh air is paradoxical if the car is polluting and emphasise how much nicer urban and rural environments are with fewer vehicles on the road.

This public groundwork would be matched by working with companies using a carrot and stick approach; rewards for companies which take effective actions that go beyond marketing messages and 'greenwash' but penalties for those that do not. And, as with the public, the government should have done the research and be able to promote the positives to industry in these discussions; eg point out that the government is going to be wholeheartedly promoting green changes to the public and that this gives business opportunities to join the trend - or to be left behind and lose customers.

After that I'll leave it to the scientists; as if it wasn't obvious from the above, I'm an arts graduate - which means at best I understand a a bit about human nature and communications but when it comes to hard facts I bow to those who have done the heavy lifting! :)",,,,,,,,0,0,322.076,0,Yes,A ban on combustion-engine cars,Additional government debt,Several times a year,Yes,Most,Strongly agree,Moderately,CO2,,Methane,Particulate matter,No,2,3,1,3,2,1,1,3,2,3,1,2,2,3,1,2,3,1,Rank 2,Rank 3,Rank 1: Most,Rank 4: Least,4,2,3,1,Rank 1: Most,Rank 3,Rank 4,Rank 5: Least,Rank 2,2,3,5,4,1,Very likely,Very unlikely,Very likely,Somewhat likely,Very likely,Very likely,Very likely,Somewhat unlikely,A great deal,Moderately,A great deal,A great deal,Moderately,4,2,3,1,5,A lot,A little,Very unlikely,Somewhat positive effects,A little,A great deal,A great deal,Not at all,A great deal,A lot,Moderately,Moderately,Not at all,Not at all,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat disagree,Neither win nor lose,Mostly win,Mostly win,Neither win nor lose,Mostly win,Strongly agree,Strongly support,Strongly support,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat disagree,Win a lot,Mostly win,Mostly win,Mostly win,Mostly win,Strongly agree,Strongly support,Additional public debt,,Increase in taxes on the wealthiest,,Reduction in military spending,43.656,116.816,117.747,15,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,Neither win nor lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Neither win nor lose,Somewhat disagree,Neither support nor oppose,Somewhat disagree,Neither support nor oppose,4.936,215.561,216.441,18,A little,Strongly support,Somewhat support,Somewhat support,Strongly support,Strongly support,2,3,1,5,4,Strongly support,Somewhat support,Somewhat support,Somewhat support,Neither support nor oppose,Somewhat support,Strongly support,Strongly support,Neither support nor oppose,1,3,2,5,6,4,7,9,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,100,16.292,278.836,279.644,18,Global,European,National,Local,Strongly agree,Much more,Much more,Strongly support,Neither agree nor disagree,Strongly disagree,Somewhat disagree,Strongly disagree,Somewhat support,Strongly support,Strongly support,Very unlikely,The choice to insulate or replace the heating system is not mine,,,,,Somewhat support,,Neither support nor oppose,Somewhat support,Somewhat support,Strongly support,2,3,1,4,Somewhat disagree,Strongly disagree,Government should do more,A very serious issue,As rich as now,"No, I do not feel it was biased","My responses to a few questions might make more sense with context about personal circumstances: I do not drive (never have) so answers about vehicles are based on impressions rather than experience; and I live in a 1930s block of flats with leasehold ownership which means that much as I would love for better insulation and a change to communal central heating, I cannot make these decisions (perhaps this is an area where government could give more power to tenants over their freeholders / management companies); I also suspect that the fabric of the building makes totally effective insulation an impossibility. Similarly, I have been vegetarian for over quarter of a century so questions about beef consumption are kind of alien to me; and not asking about my food habits might not give a full context for my answers.

This brings me to another issue: some of the questions seem to be based in rather too neat hypotheticals and general answers: eg questions about insulation do not take into account the varied nature of building standards in the UK. I found the questions about carbon tax to be problematic; in an ideal world with trustworthy government, this tax would be ring fenced but history tends to indicate that taxes tend to go into a general pot which governments draw on for all needs - especially when election time is close and they want to bribe the electorate.

The questions about beef farming and consumption gave me pause for thought. As a vegetrian I would be happy to see people finding alternatives to meat eating. But, as I understand it, a move from a carnivore diet is far from simple because stocks of animals bred for slaughter cannot be reduced in a short amount of time; and with emissions from farming being a major contribution to greenhouse gases, this is a thorny topic because it requires fast action but mass slaughter of livestock is probably not an option, either in terms of public acceptance and also pollution from disposal of the carcases. Plus a plant based diet is not without very serious ecological costs, as has been highlighted with the growth of almond 'milk' and soya use in meat substitutes.

Finally, there were one or two instances when dollar signs had not been changed to GBP and a graphic representing government in the video that looked suspiciously like the White House. Cultural imperialism! :)

Seriously, I hope that this survey produces valuable results. It was an interesting one. Oh - and I checked that the Gold Standard charity does exist before answering the question about the lottery- I wasn't aware of it but it looks like a great cause.",Yes,EN-GB,1,,4497,"""Large_urban""",0,1,"""London""",0,0,1,,,,,1,,,3,,4,2,1
