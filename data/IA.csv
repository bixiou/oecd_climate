To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget. Each country could aim to emit less than a share of the carbon budget. To respect the global carbon budget, countries that emit more than their national share would pay a fee to countries that emit less than their share.
Do you support such a policy?","Suppose the above policy is in place. How should the carbon budget be divided among countries? - The emission share of a country should be proportional to its population, so that each human has an equal right to emit.","Suppose the above policy is in place. How should the carbon budget be divided among countries? - The emission share of a country should be proportional to its current emissions, so that those who already emit more have more rights to emit.","Suppose the above policy is in place. How should the carbon budget be divided among countries? - Countries that have emitted more over the past decades (from 1990 onwards) should receive a lower emission share, because they have already used some of their fair share.","Suppose the above policy is in place. How should the carbon budget be divided among countries? - Countries that will be hurt more by climate change should receive a higher emission share, to compensate them for the damages.",Do you support or oppose establishing a global democratic assembly whose role would be to draft international treaties against climate change? Each adult across the world would have one vote to elect members of the assembly.,"Imagine the following policy: a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions funding a global basic income.


Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 8 rupees per liter in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of ₹2,200 per month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than ₹150 per day out of extreme poverty. 
The average Indian person would gain from this policy as they would face only ₹1,000 per month in price increases, which is lower that the ₹2,200 they would receive.
