To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget.

Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by R1.60 per liter in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $30 (that is, R430)  to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2/day out of extreme poverty. The average South African would lose out a bit from this policy as they would face R700 per month in price increases, which is higher than the R430 they would receive.

This is extremely short sighted. Europeans are far more progressed in this by some simple things that everyone can apply to their every day life. All it takes is a bit of education and care for our beautiful country. 
Firstly, they recycle. 
Everything can be recycled. Use less plastic. Promote refill containers rather than new plastic bottles, etc. etc. When we have aerosol cans, encourage people to use less of it and more scented bottles, which lasts longer in a glass container. Then recycle all the plastic into more useful things than plastic refuse bags. 
Encourage South Africans to recycle their bath and dish / laundry water. I have a beautiful piece of lawn which is maintained with only the bath and laundry water. This is not even expensive. We literally use a bucket to water the lawn with the bath water. That's no disgrace or something to look down on. The water is not going down the drain for waste. This will keep the plants going and the grass growing. The ecosystem can flourish with greenery. 
Secondly the usage of solar panels should be promoted. 
Without taxing it. 
People want to save money. 
Instead of charging them huge amounts in taxes, guide them and give a rebate for people who have supporting solar systems.

Not all wealthy people waste. 
If middle and low income people can have affordable electronic vehicles, it would make a huge difference. People will be eager to use RELIABLE public transport. At present, using a taxi is similar to taking a change on your life, as it is not roadworthy, let alone electronic. Something like an electronic bus would be perfect. 
People should be educated more on saving. This is something our grandparents taught us. 
Having an electronic car might not be the answer for me as I drive 120km every day to work and back. Will the power last that long? Plus, we can't afford an R800 000 electronic car. Instead we will buy a R100 000 gas vehicle. This is the same situation for many.

Although often referred to as just “global warming”, global climate change is more about serious disruptions of the entire world’s weather and climate patterns, including impacts on rainfall, extreme weather events and sea level rise, rather than just moderate temperature increases.

The developing world faces greater challenges than the developed world, both in terms of the impacts of climate change and the capacity to respond to it.

South Africa, is not required to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases. However, the South African economy is highly dependent on fossil fuels and the country can be judged to be a significant emitter due to the relatively high values that can be derived for emissions intensity and emissions per capita. 

Such calculations put South Africa as one the world's top 15 most energy intensive economies, with a significant contribution to greenhouse emissions at a continental level. 

There could be benefits to be derived from adopting a future strategy that is designed to move the economy towards a cleaner development path. This will require continued attention to the process that is currently being developed to access investment through the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, technology transfer and donor funding opportunities. 

However, even given this scenario, emissions can still be expected to increase with economic development, albeit at a smaller pace than would have happened without intervention. The Department of Minerals and Energy has developed a white paper on renewable energy and clean energy development, together with an energy efficiency programme, to support diversification towards a less carbon intensive energy economy.

Meeting international obligations South Africa, as a signatory to the UNFCCC, has to fulfil certain obligations including preparing and periodically update a national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, and formulate and implement national and, where appropriate, regional programmes to mitigate climate change and facilitate adequate adaption to climate change.

Weather patterns have changed dramatically over the past 30 years and this, together with human disregard for the environment, has exacerbated the climate problem.

However, the government needs to play a major role here. This country desperately needs to address the ongoing power problem but I see no incentivized policy which encourages the use of substitute sources like SOLAR and WIND TURBINES. There has been no evidence of a carbon footprint which is essential if we are to compare ourselves with other global players.

I suggest also to look into whether some companies are greenwashing and whether they do illegal waste in rivers and so because unfortunately that happens. If any of this is implemented people need to understand why and what the consequences in the future will be if they don't change now. That will make them more open to contribution. So an educational movie or segment should be played live Nationally in order to educate first and then after that in the next day, run another segment to give suggestions on what we as individuals can do, what companies can do to help contribute on healing the world, next show some suggestions that we could implement (for example the Paris agreement, taxing on millionaires and  better environmentally friendly car suggestions) and look at the response on social media (Mainly twitter and facebook) be sure to post all the segments on youtube and see the responses in the comments. This will guide you on what to do next. Make the segments clear to understand, visually and audibly pleasing, honest, and of good quality.

The agricultural sector and farming will be affected by climate change as well. About a year and a half ago Cape Town and the Western Cape were facing water shortages due to a drought and drinking water levels had dropped below the minimum. There should be planning put in place for things such as droughts to be able to anticipate and be ready for extreme weather conditions that could occur due to climate change. The people of the country should be the first priority having enough food and water put aside for hard times .

I feel as though this is not fully accounted for when the Theory of climate change came about. As we all know in science everything is a theory until proven incorrect or until new information is added to the findings. Climate change is not a fact that has definitely been proven otherwise they would have proven and known why the ice age occured. Now don't get me wrong there is a lot leaning more towards the idea of climate change. What isn't taken into consideration is that it cannot only be our fault and we may not be the main cause of these drastic changes in the climate around us. The earth is a large and we don't inhabit every single part of it a lot of it remains unexplored and untouched. Which leads to my next point large companies and corporations that heavily promoted the consumption of CO2 products and manufacturing processess should also be held liable for not doing their due diligence and following up on the effects of their products and practices. All the policies that are suggesting imply that people are the problem and the people need to get taxed. We breathe out carbon dioxide will we one day be taxed for that?.

It also did not cost you anything to earn that R2000. On the other hand - You inherited a million Rand, invested it and changed that into 2 million. Why must you give away half of that?  Because you risked it and made it more??? Even putting it in the bank to earn interest? NO NO NO.  What is yours is yours. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. I dont drink and I dont smoke, but I still feel it is wrong to charge those people more and more every tax year. Maybe ALL tax can be dropped and VAT made 50%. Then you can work harder, earn more, and pay the same as others on what they buy. Just my opinion.  Remember, Im 64, retired and on SASSA only...

In 2019, two provinces faced floods, not forgetting the fires and drought in other parts of the country years prior. 2021 saw the country going through yet another wave of flooding and a devastating fire in the Western Cape. These concerns have shown just how unprepared the country is in dealing with climate change. Besides these, there has been signs of extreme temperatures, which can reach the negatives or surpass 30°. With the large amount of informal settlements, it is really concerning when thinking of the effects of climate changes.

Tens of millions of people are likely to face chronic hunger leading people into poverty if inadequacy deepens.
Coastal cities will see hundreds of millions of people at risk from floods and more frequently increasing storms made more deadly by high rising sea levels. 
Millions of people living in urban areas will be exposed to water scarcity from severe droughts due to the rise of degrees Celsius.

They can also provide adequate housing for people that MUST include clean running tap water in every household in the townships and flushable toilets but mainly a way that all that waste can be monitored, controlled and recycled into things like manure and re-used and packaged to farms and or farmers to cultivate farming land and boost agriculture.

On a broader scale I think of the responsibility of corporations and government in choosing to be environmentally ethical in their business practices. I think government should impose environmental tax on companies that for example surpass certain carbon omissions,. Furthermore, SA govenmnet needs to focus on creating more public transport altenrtives,in order to reduce the number of individual cars on the road. This is obviously way more complicated than it seems due to the socio-political environment and taxi monopoly that exists. The government needs to address taxi violence so that effective and safe public transport such as bus systems can be rolled out.
