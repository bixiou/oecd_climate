To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget.

Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by R1.60 per liter in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $30 (that is, R430)  to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2/day out of extreme poverty. The average South African would lose out a bit from this policy as they would face R700 per month in price increases, which is higher than the R430 they would receive.

This is extremely short sighted. Europeans are far more progressed in this by some simple things that everyone can apply to their every day life. All it takes is a bit of education and care for our beautiful country. 
Firstly, they recycle. 
Everything can be recycled. Use less plastic. Promote refill containers rather than new plastic bottles, etc. etc. When we have aerosol cans, encourage people to use less of it and more scented bottles, which lasts longer in a glass container. Then recycle all the plastic into more useful things than plastic refuse bags. 
Encourage South Africans to recycle their bath and dish / laundry water. I have a beautiful piece of lawn which is maintained with only the bath and laundry water. This is not even expensive. We literally use a bucket to water the lawn with the bath water. That's no disgrace or something to look down on. The water is not going down the drain for waste. This will keep the plants going and the grass growing. The ecosystem can flourish with greenery. 
Secondly the usage of solar panels should be promoted. 
Without taxing it. 
People want to save money. 
Instead of charging them huge amounts in taxes, guide them and give a rebate for people who have supporting solar systems.

Not all wealthy people waste. 
If middle and low income people can have affordable electronic vehicles, it would make a huge difference. People will be eager to use RELIABLE public transport. At present, using a taxi is similar to taking a change on your life, as it is not roadworthy, let alone electronic. Something like an electronic bus would be perfect. 
People should be educated more on saving. This is something our grandparents taught us. 
Having an electronic car might not be the answer for me as I drive 120km every day to work and back. Will the power last that long? Plus, we can't afford an R800 000 electronic car. Instead we will buy a R100 000 gas vehicle. This is the same situation for many.
