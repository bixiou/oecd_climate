Police all areas, beaches, camp grounds, picnic areas. Give a huge fine for not removing your trash. Multi million dollar fines to big companies that won’t clean up their pollution. Patrol these places and catch violators and punish them.";"We need massive change and it needs to happen now. Most of the environmental damage comes from corporations and short of ending capitalism strict regulations need to happen now. I believe that capitalism (and to some extent, Western imperialism) is the cause of most of our climate problems.

However, a public awareness campaign is necessary as well so the industry has less support in fighting against regulations.

I understand it can be expensive (both monetarily and in the employment sector) to change to more environmentally friendly means, but maybe efforts to encourage transition through tax incentives and training offerings would assist in the shift? More focus on funding experimental fuels or continued social encouragement of less damaging options would keep moving the narrative toward more sustainable options.";"My main concern is global warming. In Alaska I heard that they’re ice bergs melting badly and it’s getting to hot because of us humans, that are causing global warming.";"I believe that it is a problem, I not so sure that it is caused totally by humans.
