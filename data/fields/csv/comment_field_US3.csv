In addition, these reactors can solve the problem of nuclear waste that is currently generated by uranium reactors... you can look it up.

Nuclear energy is does not contribute to climate change. I hear nothing in the public sphere about this. The federal government should change bureaucratic policies to encourage more nuclear plants to be built.\n 2. Ride sharing, and deliveries have to be contributing to climate change as the length of a trip effectively doubles for the driver, and the consumer is encouraged to use it more for minor trips. For instance, getting 1 item delivered vs. in the past going to Walmart/Target and getting a basket of goods at once. Again, I hear very little in the public policy space about this.\n 3. I have been to Europe >50 times in my life. The only policy I agree in this survey is increasing gas taxes. However, in the survey you mention giving a credit back to consumers. The U.S, already have multi-trillion dollar deficit. \n 4. I am against any and all subsidies for anyone - rich, poor, ethic groups, gender (and I am a black woman). \n 5. Most climate change issues can be remedied with more public information and common sense. The packging that I discard from an average grocery trip is obsence. Why does make-up need to be in a box? Why aren't we taxing plastic bags? Why isn't this discussed in the public sphere? I make >$500K a year, but don't buy ziploc bags. I reuse the bread bags, glass jars and other packing for storage. Reduction, reuse, and recycling, and less of once use and discarded should be demonized in our culture.";"NA";"Although I believe there is a serious problem with Climate Change and it would be in our best interests to fix the problem. There are areas where people need the use of having a car in there household. Certain areas of the country due to warmer or colder climates make it harder on the elders in society to wait in line for a bus or train.
