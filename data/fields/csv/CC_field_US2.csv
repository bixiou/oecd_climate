What an opened ended question. First and foremost, the appropriate Federal agencies should participate in a factual campaign to inform the population that climate change is an actuality and that it has nothing to do with politics, but with scientific observations. That should also include factual information as to how much of the change is due to human activity, in my opinion a very significant amount. \n \n Over and above that there needs to be an aggressive approach, and I am not sure of the specifics, to ween ourselves of the incredible dependence upon fossil fuels, one of the major causes, but certainly not the sole cause, of climate change. The average cow generates about 100 kg of methane a year, but as it is 28 times more effective than Carbon Dioxide n atmospheric warming, two cows produce a greater effect than the average motor vehicle with 4600 kg of CO2.\n \n The Federal government needs also to again cooperate with other concerned nations on a Worldwide basis in implementing positive changes, including, but not eliminated to reducing carbon emissions. We all breathe the same air as the planet turns.\n \n At the same time, there should be a quest for better understanding of the complexity  involved, and the realization that there is no panacea. Concern should be given to the possibility of major financial and employment changes as fossil fuels are replaced. \n \n The checks and balances of many other activities need to be studied and responded to as well. For example, the amount of emissions need to produce electric cars is considerably greater than those from production of hydrocarbon powered vehicles. Also, the increased demands on the electrical grid, which also uses a great deal of fossil fuel, in charging these vehicles. There are always checks and balances - gives and takes..\n \n Overall the approach needs to be massive and extremely well coordinated.
