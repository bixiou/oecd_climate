And if this current climate is not \'normal,\' what right do we even have to try and manipulate all the world, its economy, and its population to create something that we have no control over anyway? The \'green energy\' debacle in Texas this winter shows how very flawed is the thinking that \'green energy\' can do anything positive. Nor is there any consideration of the terrible environmental cost of most \'green energy\' solutions -- who cleans up the worn or wind farm propellers? Who cleans up the old and used solar panels?
