Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 40 cents per gallon in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $30/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2/day out of extreme poverty. Most Americans would lose out financially as they would face price increases in excess of $30/month.

It would be useful to maximize the amount of private sector involvement as government control tends to be inefficient.  The most logical solution (although I don't like it) is some form of consumption tax on activities which can be clearly shown to negatively impact climate with the proceeds used directly for mitigation efforts.  There also should be some consideration towards moving people out of areas that cannot be economically inhabited while mitigation efforts are underway (i.e. New Orleans).,0,0,185.634,0,Yes,8 °F,70 days per year,0,0,291.638,0,Yes,A ban on combustion-engine cars,Additional government debt,Almost never,Yes,A lot,Somewhat agree,A lot,CO2,,Methane,Particulate matter,No,1,2,3,3,2,1,1,3,2,1,2,3,2,3,1,1,3,2,Rank 1: Most,Rank 4: Least,Rank 2,Rank 3,1,4,2,3,Rank 1: Most,Rank 2,Rank 3,Rank 4: Least,3,1,2,4,Very likely,Somewhat likely,Very likely,Very likely,Very likely,Very likely,Very likely,Somewhat unlikely,A great deal,A great deal,A great deal,A great deal,A great deal,1,3,5,4,2,Not at all,Moderately,Somewhat unlikely,Very negative effects,A lot,Moderately,A lot,A lot,Moderately,Not at all,Moderately,Not at all,Moderately,Moderately,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Somewhat disagree,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Somewhat disagree,Strongly oppose,,Increase in sales taxes,,Reduction in social spending,Reduction in military spending,14.408,44.422,45.412,15,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Mostly lose,Strongly disagree,Strongly oppose,3.697,57.358,58.43,15,A little,Somewhat support,Somewhat support,Neither support nor oppose,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,1,2,3,4,5,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Neither support nor oppose,Neither support nor oppose,2,3,1,5,6,4,9,8,7,,,,,,Yes,,0,10.465,62.626,63.913,14,,Federal,State,Local,Somewhat agree,About the same,About the same,Somewhat disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat disagree,Somewhat disagree,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Somewhat likely,,,,,My insulation and heating systems are already satisfactory,Somewhat oppose,,Strongly oppose,Strongly oppose,Strongly support,Strongly oppose,4,2,3,1,Somewhat agree,Somewhat disagree,Government is doing too much,Not an issue at all,Richer,"Yes, left-wing biased","Why on earth would you redistribute carbon tax revenues back to individuals.
