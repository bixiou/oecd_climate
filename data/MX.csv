To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget. Each country could aim to emit less than a share of the carbon budget. To respect the global carbon budget, countries that emit more than their national share would pay a fee to countries that emit less than their share.
Do you support such a policy?","Suppose the above policy is in place.

Each adult across the world would have one vote to elect members of the assembly.,"Imagine the following policy: a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions funding a global basic income.


Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 40 cents per gallon in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $30/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2/day out of extreme poverty. Most Americans would lose out financially as they would face price increases in excess of $30/month.

Sin embargo, estas energías no satisfacen la demanda de energía necesaria. Problema que ha provocado una crisis energética en Europa. Elocuencia que enseña que la transición del uso de combustibles fósiles a energías ""verdes"" debe plantearse de manera prudente para no provocar crisis energética. Además, se debe entender que el petróleo seguirá siendo dentro de las próximas décadas la principal fuente energética del planeta. Si se quiere combatir el cambio climático, se debe combatir a las dos principales fuentes de contaminación: Estados Unidos y China. Ellos son quienes más contaminan en el mundo y nadie les exige un alto a sus emisiones contaminantes, tal y como en México, quieren exigir los ambientalistas ""políticos"" chafas que politizan todo para implantar prejuicios absurdos en la población.
