To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget. Each country could aim to emit less than a share of the carbon budget. To respect the global carbon budget, countries that emit more than their national share would pay a fee to countries that emit less than their share.
Do you support such a policy?","Suppose the above policy is in place.

Each adult across the world would have one vote to elect members of the assembly.,"Imagine the following policy: a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions funding a global basic income.


Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 15 cents per litre in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $41/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2.7/day out of extreme poverty. Most Australians would lose out financially as they would face $182 per month in price increases, which is higher than the $41 they would receive.

The Australian government can stop geoengineering the sky's above us and stop putting particulates into the atmosphere that are toxic to the animals which have to eat the grass that grows on that ground which now contains barium and other poisons. The terrible bushfires we had in 2019 were NOT helped by the dry ground and particulates in the soil and trees. Overall we global citizens have caused our own demise through the 75 years of geoengineering and the ionospheric heat domes, purposefully denying rain to one area while causing floods in another. But the SUN has the most constant role over millinia for the solar cycles that bring periods of increased heat and thereby increasing temperature and levels of carbon which is NOT a poison but an essential component of the atmosphere essential for growth.,and photosynthesis of plants. The star we orbit also brings solar minimums causing years of record cold and ice ages. We are in the Eddy Grand Solar Minimum and if we are to get through to 2030 and the Geeat Reset courtesy of the WEF, George Soros's Open Society Foundation aind the Foundations of the Clintons and Gates families as well as the UN's agenda 2030, the whole world is going to have to pray for a miracle because as things stand today, that ""existential threat"" you environmentalists and ""climate scientists"" keep talking about was a LONG time ago. Humanity is toast and the coming earthquakes and volcanic eruptions caused by the GSM and the coronal mass elections as well as the conjugation of the gas giants in October 2024 will both exert such massive magnetic pull on our planet causing such stress on the core which will create an elliptoid earth while that's occurring with mud floods and chaos on our dying planet.

Only it won't but it WILL bring in global Socialism under a world government.  Our current economies must crash and consumerism, free choice and freedom of any kind crashes with it only to be replaced by an energy based system based on carbon credits. You have a card, like the vaccine passports currently being rolled out around the world,  and you are allocated, a ""living wage"" under a ""Green New Deal"" -Socialism for 2030 where you must use only the carbon credits you've been allocated or you will have to trade for more to offset your overusage or have nothing until you do.. You will live in a box near to public transport because you won't own a car,. You will live without air conditioning, own nothing even your shoes, have no pets because they carry coronaviruses and are ""dirty"", just like the Jews were in Hitler's time, or at least he told the Germans they were, and we will eat no meat or dairy of any kind because of the methane they fart out. We will all have a chip to ""buy and sell"" too as well as 24/7 mobitoring of everything we do and where we go, etc. There will be no freedom. We will have a neural transplant because that's transhumanism or Human 2.0 and most young people are infertile. So no unplanned pregnancies. Most people are dead from the ""vaccines"" that have been pushed on people and there are no small businesses, home ownership or middle class. By 2050 there will be 500 million of us only Now I'm personally  happy that this world will be destroyed because by God we deserve it for our selfishness, malice and cruelty.

The Australian Government is still in total denial, supports with massive injections of funds the Coal and Gas Sector. I, and other members of my family who do not live with me,  believe both State and Federal Governments should fund a massive expansion of Solar, Wind, Hydro Renewable Energy. Australia has one of the Highest amounts of Sunlight and this should be exploited, we do have plenty of land, which is uninhabitable desert which could be used. Motor Vehicles. We should adopt Electric Vehicles (EV) and the Federal Government should fund these, directly with the buyers NOT the makers/Sales Outlets so as to bring the cost down so that as many people as possible can afford to buy one. For example a small 4/5 seater Mazda2 (Petrol) can be bought new for around $16,000. The Federal Government should stop squandering, literally , Hundreds of Billions of Dollars on Military Equipment all of which will be long obsolete (Not, my words but those of Experts in Australia, the USA and Britain) before any of it is fully operational. No-one is, or has, actually threatened or is threatening Australia. All those 100s of billions could be made available for people to buy a reasonably sized vehicle, such as an Electric Mazda2, Currently, only those with large incomes/assets can actually afford to buy an EV. The vast majority of people are Not in that high income bracket so an EV is out of the question at this time. People (individuals) are trying to do their best to address Climate Change but they can only do so much. It is beyond time the Australian Federal Government did very much more to help and contribute to addressing the catastrophic scenario the world is facing.

My home is built into rock so I have no need of Air Conditioning during the warmer months.

I don't believe that for one second, I once had one of these water/energy guzzling monsters, What they over-look is that people still rinse their dishes under a Running Hot Tap before sticking in that machine.
