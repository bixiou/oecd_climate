Jeg er ikke landmand men, de danske landmænd er dem der har det MEST miljøvenlige og klima korrekte landbrug i verden. Hvad hjælper det at lukke det hele ned og så kan alle de andre lande overtage produktionen og forurene på et helt andet niveau

Eller fly branchen !  Det kan da kun gå for langsomt med at få afgift på fly-brændstof, det virker da meget urimelig at jeg skal betale 500 % eller mere i afgift på benzin når de der flyver ikke skal betale noget.

Jeg er nærmer mig de 50 og har aldrig været ude at flyve,
eller render i fitness-center i tide og utide og brænder lys og aircondition af, eller sidder på de sociale medier konstant og brokker mig over miljøet mens tablet og mobil kører 24-7 og holder medie-serveren kørende, så den kan få brugt noget strøm samtidigt med at de store møller jeg har som nabo så står stille i blæsevejr fordi, de er ejet af nogle tyske kraftværker som ikke '' bare lige '' kan lade være med at fyre med kul.

Jeg er selv begyndt virkelig at begrænse mit indtag og køb af kød til dagligt. Jeg bor i en husstand hvor kun 1/3 spiser kød til dagligt I min optik føler jeg at det burde være muligt at skære lidt ned på salg af kød og produktion. Det kunne være at skabe kød-frie dage hos de danske familier eller gøre det officielt at danske supermarkeder ikke må sælge kød på alle ugens syv dage, og sige at man f.eks ikke sælger kød om mandagen og onsdagen eller lign. 

Slagtere har anden ret, men deres kød er også evalueret af højere kvalitet og med bedre friskhed og mindre produktionskrav. Samtidig burde kød-frie dage også blive en standard i offentlige institutioner som børnehaver/skoler/fritidshjem/plejehjem og endda arbejdspladser for at inspirere og uddanne folk i at det at spise uden om kød virkelig er muligt og der er meget potentiale i det.

Jeg støtter stærkt op om at lande som Kina, USA og Indien bør (ved jeg godt de allerede gør til en vis grad) betale og tage mere ansvar omkring klimaforandring da de er langt de største forbrugere. 

Yderligere burde ting som rejser med ""cruise ships"" blive alvorligt sænket da det i min optik er spild af fossile brændstoffer og gøre mere skade end gavn. Alt det der bliver fortaget på et cruise ship kan gøres på land.
