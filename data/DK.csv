Jeg er ikke landmand men, de danske landmænd er dem der har det MEST miljøvenlige og klima korrekte landbrug i verden. Hvad hjælper det at lukke det hele ned og så kan alle de andre lande overtage produktionen og forurene på et helt andet niveau

Eller fly branchen !  Det kan da kun gå for langsomt med at få afgift på fly-brændstof, det virker da meget urimelig at jeg skal betale 500 % eller mere i afgift på benzin når de der flyver ikke skal betale noget.

Jeg er nærmer mig de 50 og har aldrig været ude at flyve,
eller render i fitness-center i tide og utide og brænder lys og aircondition af, eller sidder på de sociale medier konstant og brokker mig over miljøet mens tablet og mobil kører 24-7 og holder medie-serveren kørende, så den kan få brugt noget strøm samtidigt med at de store møller jeg har som nabo så står stille i blæsevejr fordi, de er ejet af nogle tyske kraftværker som ikke '' bare lige '' kan lade være med at fyre med kul.

Jeg er selv begyndt virkelig at begrænse mit indtag og køb af kød til dagligt. Jeg bor i en husstand hvor kun 1/3 spiser kød til dagligt I min optik føler jeg at det burde være muligt at skære lidt ned på salg af kød og produktion. Det kunne være at skabe kød-frie dage hos de danske familier eller gøre det officielt at danske supermarkeder ikke må sælge kød på alle ugens syv dage, og sige at man f.eks ikke sælger kød om mandagen og onsdagen eller lign. 

Slagtere har anden ret, men deres kød er også evalueret af højere kvalitet og med bedre friskhed og mindre produktionskrav. Samtidig burde kød-frie dage også blive en standard i offentlige institutioner som børnehaver/skoler/fritidshjem/plejehjem og endda arbejdspladser for at inspirere og uddanne folk i at det at spise uden om kød virkelig er muligt og der er meget potentiale i det.

Jeg støtter stærkt op om at lande som Kina, USA og Indien bør (ved jeg godt de allerede gør til en vis grad) betale og tage mere ansvar omkring klimaforandring da de er langt de største forbrugere. 

Yderligere burde ting som rejser med ""cruise ships"" blive alvorligt sænket da det i min optik er spild af fossile brændstoffer og gøre mere skade end gavn. Alt det der bliver fortaget på et cruise ship kan gøres på land.

Vi burde alle tænke mere på at genanvende ting mere. Kunne fx. være, at shoppe mere i genbrug/vintage. Bruge genanvendelige poser når vi handler. 

VI burde hoppe på cyklen lidt oftere og bruge de 10 minutter mere det tager at komme til dans.
Spise mindre kød, da der bl.a. bliver over produceret. 
Spare på alt der har med strøm/energi at gøre, så varme, vand, motorer (fly, bil) osv. 

mm. 

Den danske regering kunne fx. sætte love eller andet, som vi alle bliver nødt til at følge, så selv de der ikke tænker på miljøet, hjælper.

Der bliver brugt rigtig mange ord som en kortuddannet overhovet ikke kender. 
Et eksempel: ordet ""intimidere"" Det er ikke et ord der bruges hos alm. danskere med ingen eller en kort uddannelse. Jeg har ingen gymnasieuddannelse men har via mit arbejde i en a-kasse erhvervet et stort ordforråd. Da min voksne datter brugte orden overfor mig anede jeg ikke hvad det betød og det var svært for hende (som har en bachelor) at finde et ""lavere"" ord for at forklare det.

Men filmene var ALT ALT for lange. Jeg er uddannet cand.comm. og har arbejdet med formidling af budskaber og faglige argumenter via film. En sådan film må maksimalt vare 1 minut, hvis man vil fastholde folks interesse. Den ene af filmene i denne undersøgelse varede 5 minutter - alt for lang og alt for detaljeret. Desuden blev der i filmene - og i undersøgelsen generelt brugt alt for mange ord og alt for lange sætninger - og for højt lix-tal. De fleste almindelige mennesker ved ikke hvad følgende ord fx betyder: emissioner, subsidiering og energi-infrastruktur. Derfor henvender denne undersøgelse sig til en meget smal målgruppe - og undersøgelsen har en uacceptabel politisk ideolog og slagside i sin formidling. Helt uacceptabelt bliver det, når I faktisk indleder med at fortælle, at undersøgelsen er forskning knyttet til et universitet. En sådan undersøgelse skal være objektiv og upolitisk.

For det første så er elbiler jo heller ikke uden forurening selv efter produktion. I den daglige drift udleder el biler bl.a. ozon.
De fleste nye biler kan kører på bioetanol / biodiesel. Filter teknologien til opsamling af udstødnings produkter er så langt fremme at man i dag kan opsamle 100% af restprodukterne fra udstødningen. Ved at bruge bio brændstof frem for forsilt brændstof kan man gøre meget mere. Man kan endda gøre det fra imorgen da det bare er at fylde tankstationer udelukkende med bio brændstof.
Det næste er at kloden har sin egen klima cyklus. Hvis vi ser tilbage i tiden har vi haft 3 istider, den store og 2 små. Ind imellem har der været varme perrioder. Vel at mærke perioder som lå lang tid før industrialiseringen og dermed CO2 forurening. Methan udledningen fra optøede permafrost områder er meget værre for den globale opvarmning pga størrelsen af udledningen og det faktum at methan er ca.25 gange kraftigere klimagas end CO2. vi skal husk at den forandring vi mennesker laver i naturen påvirker hele den mikrobiologiske balance. Mange bakterier udleder methan så man er nød til at se klimaforandringerne i et meget større perspektiv. Den menneskeskabte klimaforandring er også skabt af en mikrobiologisk ubalance som vi skaber ved at ødelægge naturen.",No,DA,1,,3458,,0,0,,0,0,3,,,1,,,,,,3,4,2,1

Desværre lever vi i en globaliseret og økonomi-styret verden, hvor det er vigtigere, at min. beholde, og helst øge bnp/forbruget, så politikerne tør ikke gøre noget, der virkelig batter.

Som jeg ser det, så skal vi acceptere en negativ befolkningstilvækst, hvad enten det sker ved krig, pandemier, naturkatastrofer eller reducerede muligheder for lægelige behandlinger. etc. Det er der bare ingen politikere, der tør gå ud og sige, da de så ikke bliver genvalgt. Desuden har pengemagten (læs: USA og ""den amerikanske drøm"") for meget magt, så hvis de tvinger politikerne til, gøre, som de ønsker. Hvis eksempelvis Danmark stopper med, at forbruge unødvendig elektronik (nye modeller af PC/TV), vil vi sakke bagud i forhold til andre lande, og vil risikere, at ende som et u-land. 

Problemet ligger også i, at mennesket er stræberisk og så tilpas dumme, at det tror, at materiel rigdom er fremtiden og værd at stræbe efter.

Bare 1 eksempel er, at man ikke må bruge egne sættekartofler, men skal købe dem.
