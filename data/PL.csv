To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget.

Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 40 cents per gallon in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $30/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2/day out of extreme poverty. Most Americans would lose out financially as they would face price increases in excess of $30/month.

Możliwość oddawania surowców do skupów. Dawać dotacje dla firm które dbają o środowisko - starają się zmniejszać wykorzystywanie prądu, wody w produkcji, mają opakowania EKO, czy też opakowania te są zwrotne, bądź produkowane z recyklingu. 
Dodatkowo można by pomyśleć o zniżkach dla osób posiadających prawo jazdy na transport publiczny, darmowe parkingi na obrzeżach miast.
Duże dofinansowania dla gmin, na energię odnawialną, wykorzystywaną dla miasta, jak i dla mieszkańców - np. panele słoneczne dla bloków.
Dobrą myślą byłyby zwiększenie patroli SM sprawdzających czym ludzie palą w piecach.
Kontrola bez zapowiedzi i dość częsta, zakładów produkcyjnych/przemysłowych, co i jak wypuszczają do środowiska, narzucanie obowiązku zakładania solidnych filtrów i wszelkich zabezpieczeń przed wydalaniem chemii - olbrzymie kary finansowe za brak spełnianych norm - konsekwencja w działaniu.
Mobilizowanie społeczeństwa do korzystania z rowerów i hulajnóg, w celu przemieszczania się - np. możliwość odliczenia od podatku takiego zakupu.
Kampanie dotyczące konkretnych zachowań dotyczących dbania o środowisko, wciąż jest ich zbyt mało i są za mało widoczne.
Nakładanie na firmy i prywatne osoby dużych kar pieniężnych za zanieczyszczanie, nie sprzątanie po sobie, czy ignorowanie zasad - w kontekście mocnego dociekania kto np wyrzuca śmieci w lesie, przy mało uczęszczanych drogach - nie umarzać postępowania, powołać specjalny dział który się tym zajmie i koszta dochodzenia, plus kara do pokrycia przez sprawce.

Teraz bardzo zwracam uwagę na cenę i czasem jestem zmuszona wziąć tańszy produkt, zapakowany w mniej ekologiczne opakowanie, co powoduje że również mniej się zwraca uwagę na produkcję.
