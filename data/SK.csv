To limit global warming to this level, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally, called the carbon budget.

Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 40 cents per gallon in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $30/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2/day out of extreme poverty. Most Americans would lose out financially as they would face price increases in excess of $30/month.
