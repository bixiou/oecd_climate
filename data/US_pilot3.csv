The funding for these investments could be collected annually through an additional individual contribution for the foreseeable future. Assume that everyone in the U.S. as well as citizens of other countries would be required to contribute according to their means.
How much would you at most be willing to pay annually through an additional individual contribution to limit global warming to safe levels (less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit)?","By taking this survey, you are automatically entered into a lottery to win $100. In a few days you will know whether you have been selected in the lottery. The payment will be made to you in the same way as your compensation for this survey, so no further action is required on your part. 

  
You can also donate a part of this additional compensation (should you be selected in the lottery) to a reforestation project through the charity The Gold Standard. This charity has already proven effective to reduce 151 million tons of CO2 to fight climate change and has been carefully selected by our team. The Gold Standard is highly transparent and ensures that its projects featured the highest levels of environmental integrity and contribute to sustainable development.

Each adult across the world would have one vote to elect members of the assembly.,"Imagine the following policy: a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions funding a global basic income.


Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 40 cents per gallon in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $30/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2/day out of extreme poverty. Most Americans would lose out financially as they would face price increases in excess of $30/month.

It should also offer programs to people who work in the fossil fuel energy to help them transition to a more sustainable career.  For example, it could offer training programs to coal miners that would help them switch careers.  It could also offer retirement packages to older coal miners.

The federal government could also help fund scientists who are studying climate change and ways to combat it.

In theory, all of the proposed policy changes will be beneficial.  However, partial or unfairly targeted implementations (e.g. higher gasoline prices or automobile noncompliance penalties WITHOUT targeted redistribution) will hurt the working poor and true middle class a great deal. One percenters are masters at passing the bill 
for infrastructure and other tax funded amenities (which benefit them disproportionately) to the rest of us. Making sure they can't dodge their proportionate share of the cost will be a herculean effort.

Roll back the tax holiday the millionaire sector has enjoyed since Cheney/Reagan. Use those funds to repair and rebuild infrastructure using green technologies.  

Incent businesses to implement work from home throughout their organizations-- imagine the carbon emissions reduction! Not to mention the health and work-life balance benefits. (No excuses, COVID 19 has made it clear that this measure is entirely workable for most office and professional employees.) 

Move toward more distance learning for higher grade level students, reducing both emissions and school-based bullying. Younger children can benefit from more space and smaller class sizes. (In fact, let's move away altogether from the warehousing approach to education.)

We need national regulations with teeth to shut down public forum lying by commission or omission, with the highest penalties up to and including imprisonment for public office holders. (I've heard that UK may provide a good benchmark. Do we need a Constitutional Amendment--Freedom from BS and Betrayal of Public Trust?)

1)  destroy America financially
2)  allow other countries (China specifically) to overtake America financially and militarily in just a few years
3)  destroy the poorer people and middle class because ALL of these proposals will come with HEAVY taxation that will hurt these two classes the most BY FAR.  The subsidies they would receive is the Gov't paying these people back their own tax money; the $600 is NOTHING compared to the added expense these people will have to pay as a result of these idiotic ideas policies

The policies make the assumption that all world players contribute: good fucking luck getting that to happen.  China will use this stupidity to simply take over sooner.  They will say they are going to comply like they did before.  OH by the way since the Paris Climate Accord was discussed China built in excess of 250 coal fired power plants.  Guess they didn't get the message.  They pollute FAR more than we ever will.  

The U.S. does more than any other nation to make the environment clean for ALL people.  The problem is India, China, even the EU do really give a shit about being serious on the environment UNLESS WE PAY FOR IT!

One other elephant in the room.  alternative power sources create massive pollution problems down stream.  Wind turbines destroy the environment: kill 1000's of birds including endangered species, the create disorientation in fish when built in or near waterways (check Norway study) disrupting the electrical flow in the water making fish change their migration patterns and making some species stop spawning.  HMMM big issue!   Electric cars: how do you dispose of the batteries? They are a significant pollutant and no one wants to mention that.  Nuclear would be better but no one wants to say that either.

So when the government talks and has implemented certain rules for vehicles, ( no rust, tire tread, gas mileage, etc,) that leaves very few who are either poor or lower to middle class.

How can they say, "" stop using plastic?"" when many of these people in poorer areas have actual uses for them. Not only that, but instead they offer, ( for a price,) paper bags. I don't care if the paper is recycled, it's still having an effect on trees, which obviously we need.

These neighborhoods were shown what to use instead to grow their own foods & also how to use natural products, instead of chemicals for every day cleaning. 

It's a non-profit org. They ""hire"" interns, starting w/ teens and higher ages who learn and then spread their new knowledge into their individual communities. They learn things they would not have learned if not being involved. They also started limiting their consumption of meats, beefs, chicken, etc...knowing now how farming these animals has harmed the world.
