The three \textit{Income} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people in the first quartile of household's annual income in 2019 (i.e. income $<$ \textdollar 35,000). The two \textit{age} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people aged between 18 and 29. The two \textit{vote} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people who either did not vote in the 2020 Presidential election or voted for another candidate than Biden or Trump. The \textit{wave: Pilote 2} indicator variable indicate difference in mean for the second wave of the pilote compared to the first wave.
