	The \textit{race: White only} indicator variable equals one if the respondent's self reported race is only ``White". The regression includes controls for gender, having children and having completed a college degree. The three \textit{status} indicator variables indicate the difference in mean compared to a reference group of people not working (either unemployed or inactive).

The two \textit{age} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people aged between 18 and 29. The two \textit{vote} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people who either did not vote in the 2020 Presidential election or voted for another candidate than Biden or Trump.
