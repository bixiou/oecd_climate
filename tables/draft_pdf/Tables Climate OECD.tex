The three \textit{status} indicator variables indicate the difference in mean compared to a reference group of people not working (either unemployed or inactive). The \textit{status: Working} indicator variable includes respondents who self-reported being either ``Full-time employed", ``Part-time employed", or ``Self-employed". The three \textit{Income} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people in the first quartile of household's annual income in 2019 (i.e. income $<$ \textdollar 35,000). The four \textit{age} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people aged between 18 and 24. The two \textit{vote} indicator variables include either people who actually voted for the candidate in the 2020 Presidential election or who did not vote but indicate they would have voted for this candidate.

The \textit{Rationing} variables equal one if the respondent thinks no one should be allowed to fly more than the quota in brackets between now and 2040. The \textit{Tradable} variables equal one of the respondent thinks people should be able to trade their rights to fly. The quota used to frame the question is randomly selected from three different options. The \textit{(1000km)} variables refer to respondents who are asked about a quota of 1000km/person/year, the \textit{(3000km)} variables to respondents asked about a quota of 3000km/person/year, and the \textit{(0.5 round-trip/year)} to respondents asked about a quota of 1 round-trip/person/2years.

The \textit{Tax on cattle products (beefx2)} refers to ``A high tax on cattle products, so that the price of beef doubles", the \textit{Sub. Vegetables} variable to ``Subsidies on organic and local vegetables, fruits and nuts", the \textit{No sub. cattle} variable to ``The removal of subsidies for cattle farming", and the \textit{Ban intensive cattle} to ``The ban of intensive cattle farming."

The \textit{government to do what is right} variable equals one if the respondent indicates trusting the U.S. government to do what is right ``Nearly all the time" or "Most of the time." The \textit{government to spend revenue wisely} variable equals one if the respondent indicates to ``fully agree" or ``somewhat agree" that authorities spend the revenue obtained from taxes and fees in a sensible way.

The \textit{Inequality serious problem} equals one if the respondent indicates that in the U.S. inequality is ``A serious problem" or ``A very serious problem." The \textit{World poorer or same} variable equals one if the respondent indicates that in 100 years the world will be ``About as rich as now on average" or ``Poorer."
