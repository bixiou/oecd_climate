The three \textit{status} indicator variables indicate the difference in mean compared to a reference group of people not working (either unemployed or inactive). The \textit{status: Working} indicator variable includes respondents who self-reported being either ``Full-time employed", ``Part-time employed", or ``Self-employed".

	{\footnotesize Note: The \textit{Affected Index} variable is a summary index for being affected by climate policies. It is based on working in a polluting sector, using a car or a motorbike for transportation, gas and heating expenses, the availability of public transports, the size of town, and living in a rural area. The \textit{Knowledge Index} variable is a summary index for being knowledgeable about climate policies. It is based on knowledge about emissions  (for transport, electricity, food, regions, and per capita), climate change impacts, greenhouse gases, climate change dynamic, climate change being anthropogenic, climate change being real, and considering oneself knowledgeable about climate change. The \textit{Knowledge Index (EFA)} variable is a summary index for being knowledgeable about climate policies with weights being loadings from explanatory factor analysis. The \textit{$CO_2$ emissions (t/year)} variable corresponds to estimated emissions from heating and gas expenses, flights and income. The standard deviation of \textit{$CO_2$ emissions (t/year)} is 6.124. The \textit{Core metropolitan} variable equals one if the respondent lives in a core metropolitan area.
