\section{Summary}
\begin{frame}{Project status}
\begin{itemize}
\item United States:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 2,010 responses collected (focus of this presentation).
	\end{itemize}
\item Denmark: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item currently collecting answers
	\end{itemize}
\item  France: translation done

\item India, UK, Spain, Germany:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Video script adjusted
	\item Translation and video will start soon as we validate the questionnaire from the US experience
\end{itemize}
%Survey will be adjusted to the national context with input from colleagues.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key findings}
\begin{itemize}
\item People worry about the negative impacts of climate change; Knowledge of climate change related impacts is relatively good.

\item Most people agree that CC is a problem and that ambitious policies are needed.

\item A majority under-estimate the necessary policy stringency to reduce emissions.

\item Two-thirds are willing to change their behavior as long as it doesnâ€™t affect their comfort and they have enough financial means (one-third is willing to forego some comfort).

\item Support for our three specific policies is mixed, lower than in the pilot.

\item The policy treatment increases public support for carbon tax and the ban on combustion-engine cars.
\end{itemize}

        \item Most people understand what activities are most polluting, except for transport where knowledge is mixed. Most struggle identifying the correct ranking of regional per capita footprint.
        \item Most people correctly understand that climate change will entail more natural disasters, but wrongly think that volcanic eruptions will be more frequent.
        \item A majority thinks that CC puts humanity at risk of extinction, which is extremely pessimistic.
        \item A relative majority thinks they will be personally affected by CC.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Most people agree CC is a problem and ambitious policies are needed.
    \item People are divided between optimistic and pessimistic (regarding future standards of living, technical feasibility to stop CC, and likelihood it will happen).
    \item People are divided between those who foresee positive effects of climate policies and a third who foresees negative effects.
    \item A third of people is willing to forego some comfort, two-thirds are willing to change behavior as long as it doesn't affect their comfort and they have enough financial means.
    %   \item Only a slight majority recognizes that each of us are highly responsible for climate change, while around 70\% perceive companies are highly responsible for climate change.
    %     \item People are divided about whether climate change can be halted by the end of the century, but only 20\% think ambitious policies are not important to halt it.
    %     \item Around 20\% also think that ambitious policies would have strong negative effects on their lifestyle and around 30\% think ambitious policies would have negative effects on the U.S. economy. 
    %     \item It can be linked to the fact that only a minority is willing to adopt the most restrictive behaviors. Different types of constraints seem to influence their decisions.

To fight climate change, car producers can be required by law to produce cars that emit less CO2 per mile of the cars they sell. The emission limit is lowered every year so that only electric or hydrogen vehicles can be sold after 2030. This policy is called a \textit{ban on combustion-engine cars}.

\section{Policy 2: Green Infrastructure Program}

\begin{frame}{Policy description}%\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}
A green infrastructure program is a large public investment program, which would be financed by additional public debt, to accomplish the transition needed to cut greenhouse gases emissions. Investments would concern renewable power plants, public transportation, thermal renovation of building, and sustainable agriculture.
\end{frame}

\section{Policy 3: Carbon Tax with Cash Transfers}

\begin{frame}{Policy description}%\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}
To fight climate change, the U.S. federal government can make greenhouse gas emissions costly, to make people and firms change their equipment and reduce their emissions. The government could do this through a policy called a carbon tax with cash transfers. Under such a policy, the government would tax all products that emit greenhouse gas. For example, the price of gasoline would increase by 40 cents per gallon. To compensate households for the price increases, the revenues from the carbon tax would be redistributed to all households, regardless of their income. Each adult would thus receive \$600 per year.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Effects of the policy}%\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}

\textbf{Problem:} strong acquiescence bias. In the pilot, 53\% agreed that it was ``cost-effective''. Formulation changed to ``costly'' and 55\% agree.

\section{Preferences for Climate Policies}

\begin{frame}{Preferences for climate policies: summary}
    \begin{itemize}
       % \item Each specific policy proposed gathers a majority, the most favored being a ban on combustion-engine cars.
        \item Each specific policy proposed gathers more support than opposition but the only one with more ``Strongly support'' than ``Strongly oppose'' is the green infrastructure program.
        \item People are divided regarding the properties of these policies, and the answers may suffer from acquiescence or other bias. %although most think than a green infrastructure program and a ban on combustion-engine cars would be cost-effective to fight CC.
        \item A majority supports each climate policy proposed (including coercive measures such as mandatory insulation of buildings) except tax policies and policies against meat. 
        %\item The results regarding taxes go in the other direction than the first two pilots (maybe because of the more accurate level of taxes mentioned).
        % \item However earmarking the revenues of the tax on fossil fuel, in particular for investments in green infrastructures or technologies, can lead a majority to support this policy.
        \item Earmarking carbon tax revenues to green investments is the preferred option while uses of revenue for firms are the least favored.
        \item A majority is willing to pay \$100/year to halt climate change, which is higher than the pilot' median at \$50/year (before we switched to binary question), but is still low. 
        \item However, the median amount people are willing to donate to a charity is \$25 (over a potential gain of \$100). 
        \item Most people are willing to insulate or replace heating of their accommodation, the cost of doing so is the bigger obstacle.

   % \item In particular, all treatments are associated with the belief that CC can cause the extinction of human kind.
    \item The Policy treatment has a large positive effect on support for a carbon tax with transfers (+13 p.p.), which can be linked to its effect on fairness and incidence on poor for this policy.
    \item The Policy treatment also has a positive effect on support for the ban on combustion-engine (7 p.p.).
    % and green infrastructure program (4 p.p.).
    \item The Climate treatment has a negative effect on willingness to limit driving and support for green infrastructure program, which might be spurious correlation.
    \item Low or null treatment effects may also be the result of respondents not updating the information on the policies (ban of combustion-engine cars and green infrastructure program), or due to lack of attentiveness to the videos (knowledge score on the videos seem low).
