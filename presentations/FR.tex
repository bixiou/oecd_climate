%\begin{itemize}
%\item People worry about the negative impacts of climate change; Knowledge of climate change related impacts is relatively good.
%
%\item Most people agree that CC is a problem and that ambitious policies are needed.
%
%\item A majority under-estimate the necessary policy stringency to reduce emissions.
%
%\item Two-thirds are willing to change their behavior as long as it doesnâ€™t affect their comfort and they have enough financial means (one-third is willing to forego some comfort).
%
%\item Support for our three specific policies is mixed, lower than in the pilot.
%
%\item The policy treatment increases public support for carbon tax and the ban on combustion-engine cars.

\section{Policy 3: Carbon Tax with Cash Transfers}

\begin{frame}{Policy description}%\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}
To fight climate change, the French government can make greenhouse gas emissions costly, to make people and firms change their equipment and reduce their emissions. The government could do this through a policy called a carbon tax with cash transfers. Under such a policy, the government would tax all products that emit greenhouse gas. For example, the price of gasoline would increase by 10 centimes par litre. To compensate households for the price increases, the revenues from the carbon tax would be redistributed to all households, regardless of their income. Each adult would thus receive 160\euro{} per year.

%\textbf{Problem:} strong acquiescence bias. In the pilot, 53\% agreed that it was ``cost-effective''. Formulation changed to ``costly'' and 57\% agree.

%        \item Each specific policy proposed gathers more support than opposition but the only one with more ``Strongly support'' than ``Strongly oppose'' is the green infrastructure program.
%        \item People are divided regarding the properties of these policies, and the answers may suffer from acquiescence or other bias. %although most think than a green infrastructure program and a ban on combustion-engine cars would be cost-effective to fight CC.
%        \item A majority supports each climate policy proposed (including coercive measures such as mandatory insulation of buildings) except tax policies and policies against meat. 
%        %\item The results regarding taxes go in the other direction than the first two pilots (maybe because of the more accurate level of taxes mentioned).
%        % \item However earmarking the revenues of the tax on fossil fuel, in particular for investments in green infrastructures or technologies, can lead a majority to support this policy.
%        \item Earmarking carbon tax revenues to green investments is the preferred option while uses of revenue for firms are the least favored.
%        \item A majority is willing to pay \$100/year to halt climate change, which is higher than the pilot' median at \$50/year (before we switched to binary question), but is still low. 
%        \item However, the median amount people are willing to donate to a charity is \$25 (over a potential gain of \$100). 
%        \item Most people are willing to insulate or replace heating of their accommodation, the cost of doing so is the bigger obstacle.

\begin{frame}{Descriptions of Indexes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Indexes are non-weighted average of z-scores
  \item Each z-score is normalizeed with survey weights, control mean group and sd mean group. Impute mean of treatment group to missing values.
  \item \textit{Affected Index:} polluting sector, transports used, expenses in gas and heating, availability of public transport, size of town, urbanity.
  \item \textit{Knowledge Index:} scores on footprint questions, knowledge on the dynamic, reality, and anthropogenic diemsnions of climate change, knowledge of the impacts origins of climate change.
  \item \textit{Knowledge Index (EFA):} weights are loadings from explanatory factor analysis.
