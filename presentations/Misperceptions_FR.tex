% 1) Can you start by showing that people have misperceptions about the causes of CC and the impacts of their actions?
% 2) Can you show lack of understanding of policies?
% 3) Can we expand Adrien’s earlier result in his AEJ paper that people over estimate to what extent they will lose?
% 4) Can we show aversion to changing one’s own life style? Or lack of understanding of the magnitudes of what has to be done?
% 5) Can we try and make some clear statements about what info treatments work? We dont need heterogeneity here, let’s stay simple and try to make the point of what works?

\section{(Mis)perceptions of climate policies}

\begin{frame}{Policies precisely described}%\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}
	\begin{itemize}
	\ip \textcolor{blue}{Ban on Combustion Engine Cars}: To fight climate change, car producers can be required by law to produce cars that emit less CO$_\text{2}$ per km of the cars they sell. The emission limit is lowered every year so that only electric or hydrogen vehicles can be sold after 2030. This policy is called a \textit{ban on combustion-engine cars}.
	\ip \textcolor{blue}{Green Infrastructure Program}: A green infrastructure program is a large public investment program, which would be financed by additional public debt, to accomplish the transition needed to cut greenhouse gases emissions. Investments would concern renewable power plants, public transportation, thermal renovation of building, and sustainable agriculture.
	\ip \textcolor{blue}{Carbon Tax with Cash Transfers}: To fight climate change, the French government can make greenhouse gas emissions costly, to make people and firms change their equipment and reduce their emissions. The government could do this through a policy called a carbon tax with cash transfers. Under such a policy, the government would tax all products that emit greenhouse gas. For example, the price of gasoline would increase by 10 cents per liter. To compensate households for the price increases, the revenues from the carbon tax would be redistributed to all households, regardless of their income. Each adult would thus receive 160\euro{} per year.
