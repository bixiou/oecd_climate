% Section Survey and Data: 
% Need to describe i) sample ii) survey blocks —> refer to online Appendix for questionnaires in original language (we would need them all nicely formatted) + survey link if available (but not the one we are actually using to collect data, rather we need a mock one)

% Section Knowledge: 

% Split into: What are key things that people misperceive? 
% What are things that they are relatively well aware of?

% One section on “Who has better knowledge?” Just a regression of some summary measure of knowledge on individual characteristics. 

% Policy message of this section 
% Who knows more? Where is key info lacking (that policy makers should fix).  

% Section on who supports climate change policies. 

% Regress Outcomes on set A and set B. Identify main patterns. 
% In Appendix: Full regression tables. 
% In paper: 4-5 of they key heterogeneities, shown in graphical format. For instance, Tobias already identified that driving and relying on energy was important; Adrien pointed to age. 

% LDA analysis to identify “types” of respondents. Perhaps in Appendix by country, in main paper all countries pooled? 

% Section on what makes people support climate change policies

% A. Mechanisms. 
% Regress Outcomes on set C + set A (—> answers the question of what type of thinking needs to changed 
% (We already did nice figures like this, but we needed to reorganize what was a mechanism and what was an outcome) 

% B. Gelbach decompositions of the key heterogeneities (e.g.: what makes people of different ages support different policies) into the mechanisms of set C. 

% C. Provide description of Treatments with screen shots. 
% Regress Outcomes on treatment indicators + set A. 

% Appendix: (these are a lot of work, so thanks in advance Bluebery for chipping in here, I know this is a ton. so ask me if need extra power, I can enroll more RAs.)
% All questionnaires in original language (as noted above)
% More details on the sampling and survey company (including dates at which the surveys done in each country). 
% Sample characteristics country by country, as compared to national characteristics. 
% Full regression tables for the parts outlined above, so that the text can focus on nice figures. 


% \begin{frame}{Motivation}
% \bbs
% \ip Climate policies have been difficult to pass.
% \ip The design of climate policies needs to account for the political economy and public acceptability.
% \ip \textcolor{blue}{Resistance to climate policies} arises largely from:
% \bbs
% \ip Legitimate concerns about \textcolor{blue}{distributional and lifestyle impacts}
% \ip \textcolor{blue}{Misconceptions} about the impacts of climate change and the effects of climate policies on the economy and the environment
% \ee 
% \ip Addressing concerns and misconceptions may be difficult, as they are influenced by personal attributes, country specificities and political views.
% \ee
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Project objectives}
% \bbs
% \ip \textcolor{blue}{Overall goal:} contribute to construct country-specific advice on policies to deal with the transition to a low-carbon economy by understanding people’s perceptions about climate change and preferences over available climate policies.
% \ip \textcolor{blue}{Research questions:}
% \bbs
% \ip How social attitudes, values, and perceptions drive support or opposition for climate policies across socio-economic groups?
% \ip How social preferences on climate change mitigation policies differ between countries?
% \ip How perceptions may change after receiving new information on the effects of policies/climate change (in a video format) and how it translates into beliefs and support?
% \ee
% \ee
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Method: Large-scale Social Economics Surveys and Experiments}
% \bb
% \ip \textcolor{magenta}{Surveys are a key tool:}
% \bbs 
% \ip Some aspects cannot be perceived in other data, not matter how good they are: Perceptions, attitudes, knowledge, views.
% \ip Revealed preference with observational data has limits (data and assumptions required).

% \ip Unlike old-style surveys (that measure variables now better captured in admin data) or opinion polls (less rigorous, often partial, without randomized treatments). 
% \ip New generation surveys: Customizable, controllable, interactive.
% \ee
% \ip This study: $\approx$ 2,000 respondents per survey, broadly representative of the country, done through commercial survey companies. 
% \ee
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Improvements upon existing research}
% \bbs
% \ip \textcolor{blue}{Wide scope}: past surveys are typically limited to a single (developed) country, focus on carbon pricing,
% and existing international surveys include only very general questions.
% \bbs
% \ip For reviews of existing studies: Carattini et al. 2018, Drews and van den Bergh, 2016
% \ee 
% \ip \textcolor{blue}{Cross-country comparability}: having an international questionnaire informs whether differences in people’s attitudes are driven by survey characteristics (e.g. format and phrasing) or by true cross-country differences.
% \ip \textcolor{blue}{Incentive compatibility}: we offer an incentive relying on an actual payment and propose tangible actions.
% \ip \textcolor{blue}{Causal evidence}: we document effects of informational treatments in a video format, whereas cross-country evidence remains largely descriptive and national surveys use less effective treatments.
% \ee
% \end{frame}


% %\begin{frame}{Main research questions}
% %\bbs
% %\ip \textcolor{blue}Drivers of policy support}: reveal how socio-demographics, values, and perceptions drive
% %support or opposition for climate policies.
% %\ip \textcolor{blue}{Cross-country comparisons}: analyze how social preferences on climate change
% %mitigation policies differ between countries.
% %\ip \textcolor{blue}{Effects of informational treatments}: understand how perceptions may change after
% %receiving new information on the effects of policies/climate change (in a video
% %format) and how it translates into beliefs and support.
% %\ee
% %\end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Informational treatments}
% \bbs
% \ip Treatments consist in one or two 2--5 min video either informing the respondent about
% \textcolor{blue}{three main climate policies}, or detailing the \textcolor{blue}{impacts of climate change in their country}.
% \ip \textcolor{magenta}{Goal}: understand \textcolor{blue}{how perceptions may change after
% receiving new information} on the effects of policies/climate change (in a video
% format) and how it translates into policy support.
% \ip Will contribute to ongoing academic debate on importance of information for the acceptance of climate policies (e.g. Kahan, 2015; Sunstein et al., 2017):
% \bbvs
% \ip What do people really learn when information is provided?
% \ip Do they accept the info or can it backfire?
% \ip How does the effect interact with political values, previous knowledge, socio-demographics, country?

\section{Sample quality -- France}

%- Add more tables? Effect of misperception + heterogeneity (indices) for instance
%- Do we add something on the LDA ?%

%- In table underline some key lines ? Like in slide 36 here: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stantcheva/files/understanding_taxes_slides.pdf
%- Pour le moment la présentation est vraiment descriptive (liste les réponses à chaque question), mais est-ce que l'on veut faire ça ou avoir un narrative (à travers une research question à laquelle on veut réponse et en faisant des sections sur les résultats préliminaires que l'on a, plutôt que de grouper block par block - même si ça va sûrement être très proche)

\begin{frame}{Ensuring data quality}
\bbs
\ip 2,006 respondents selected through quotas that  \textcolor{blue}{ensure representativeness} along: \\ \textcolor{magenta}{gender, age, income, region, diploma, urban/rural}.
\ip \textcolor{blue}{All results are re-weighted} along quota variables (except rural/urban) to increase representativeness even further.
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Screening question} in the middle of the survey. 
\ip Appeal to people's social responsibility. 
\ip Warn that ``incoherent and \textcolor{blue}{rushed responses'' (< 11 min) are dismissed} and disqualified for monetary compensation.
\ip Record time spent on separate questions \& overall survey (median: 27 min).
\ip Ask for feedback post survey, whether felt survey was biased (\textcolor{magenta}{78\% find it unbiased}).
%\ip Check careless response patterns (clicking same ``middle'' answer).

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Key take-home messages for policy-making}
\bbvs
\ip Widespread concern for climate change and large support for global climate policies.
\ip Majority support for a green infrastructure program
\ip Mixed support for a carbon tax with cash transfers and a ban of combustion-engine cars. % people want it to be clear that the rich pay for the provision of new infrastructure rather than having to pay for themselves and compensated ex post 
%\ip Majority support for different norms and regulations.
\ip Attitudes are largely idiosyncratic.
\ip Availability of decarbonized alternatives like public transport is key. 
\ip The distributional fairness of the policy packge is critical for the acceptance of many people. \\ $\Rightarrow$ Make sure the policy package is progressive, and that people understand that.
%\ip Knowledge that climate change is anthropogenic and trust in government are key beliefs to support climate policies.
\ip Information can improve understanding of a carbon tax with cash transfers, and thereby increase support.

\subsection{Comparison across the 3 Policies:}

\begin{frame}{Policies precisely described}%\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}
\begin{itemize}
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Ban on Combustion Engine Cars}: To fight climate change, car producers can be required by law to produce cars that emit less CO$_\text{2}$ per km of the cars they sell. The emission limit is lowered every year so that only electric or hydrogen vehicles can be sold after 2030. This policy is called a \textit{ban on combustion-engine cars}.
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Green Infrastructure Program}: A green infrastructure program is a large public investment program, which would be financed by additional public debt, to accomplish the transition needed to cut greenhouse gases emissions. Investments would concern renewable power plants, public transportation, thermal renovation of building, and sustainable agriculture.
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Carbon Tax with Cash Transfers}: To fight climate change, the French government can make greenhouse gas emissions costly, to make people and firms change their equipment and reduce their emissions. The government could do this through a policy called a carbon tax with cash transfers. Under such a policy, the government would tax all products that emit greenhouse gas. For example, the price of gasoline would increase by 10 cents per liter. To compensate households for the price increases, the revenues from the carbon tax would be redistributed to all households, regardless of their income. Each adult would thus receive 160\euro{} per year.

%\begin{frame}{Preferences for climate policies: summary}
%    \begin{itemize}
%       % \item Each specific policy proposed gathers a majority, the most favored being a ban on combustion-engine cars.
%        \item Each specific policy proposed gathers more support than opposition but the only one with more ``Strongly support'' than ``Strongly oppose'' is the green infrastructure program.
%        \item People are divided regarding the properties of these policies, and the answers may suffer from acquiescence or other bias. %although most think than a green infrastructure program and a ban on combustion-engine cars would be cost-effective to fight CC.
%        \item A majority supports each climate policy proposed (including coercive measures such as mandatory insulation of buildings) except tax policies and policies against meat. 
%        %\item The results regarding taxes go in the other direction than the first two pilots (maybe because of the more accurate level of taxes mentioned).
%        % \item However earmarking the revenues of the tax on fossil fuel, in particular for investments in green infrastructures or technologies, can lead a majority to support this policy.
%        \item Earmarking carbon tax revenues to green investments is the preferred option while uses of revenue for firms are the least favored.
%        \item A majority is willing to pay \$100/year to halt climate change, which is higher than the pilot' median at \$50/year (before we switched to binary question), but is still low. 
%        \item However, the median amount people are willing to donate to a charity is \$25 (over a potential gain of \$100). 
%        \item Most people are willing to insulate or replace heating of their accommodation, the cost of doing so is the bigger obstacle.

To fight climate change, car producers can be required by law to produce cars that emit less CO$_\text{2}$ per mile of the cars they sell. The emission limit is lowered every year so that only electric or hydrogen vehicles can be sold after 2030. This policy is called a \textit{ban on combustion-engine cars}.

A green infrastructure program is a large public investment program, which would be financed by additional public debt, to accomplish the transition needed to cut greenhouse gases emissions. Investments would concern renewable power plants, public transportation, thermal renovation of building, and sustainable agriculture.

\subsection{Policy 3: Carbon Tax with Cash Transfers}

\begin{frame}{Policy description}%\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}
To fight climate change, the French government can make greenhouse gas emissions costly, to make people and firms change their equipment and reduce their emissions. The government could do this through a policy called a carbon tax with cash transfers. Under such a policy, the government would tax all products that emit greenhouse gas. For example, the price of gasoline would increase by 10 cents per liter. To compensate households for the price increases, the revenues from the carbon tax would be redistributed to all households, regardless of their income. Each adult would thus receive 160\euro{} per year.
