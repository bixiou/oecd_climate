\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\bbs
\ip Climate policies have been difficult to pass.
\ip The design of climate policies needs to account for the political economy and public acceptability.
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Resistance to climate policies} arises largely from:
\bbs
\ip Legitimate concerns about \textcolor{blue}{distributional and lifestyle impacts}
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Misconceptions} about the impacts of climate change and the effects of climate policies on the economy and the environment
\ee 
\ip Addressing concerns and misconceptions may be difficult, as they are influenced by personal attributes, country specificities and political views.
\ee
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An international survey}
\bbs
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Large-scale cross-country survey} to analyse attitudes on climate change and climatep policies.
\ip Wide country coverage:
\bbvs
\ip \textcolor{blue}{16 countries} in all world regions, low-income as well as high-income, 
\ip \textcolor{blue}{covering two-thirds of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions}, including 16 out of the 21 largest polluters.
\ee

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Improvements upon existing research}
\bbs
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Scope is wide}: past surveys are typically limited to a single (developed) country, focus on carbon pricing,
and existing international surveys include only very general questions
\bbs
\ip For reviews of the surveys: Carattini et al. 2018, Drews and van den Bergh, 2016
\ee 
\ip Cross-country comparability: having an international questionnaire informs whether differences in people’s attitudes are driven by survey characteristics (e.g. format and phrasing) or by true cross-country differences
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Causal evidence}: we document effects of informational treatments, wheareas cross-country evidence remains largely descriptive.
\ip \textcolor{blue}{Incentive compatibility}: we offer an incentive relying on an actual payment and propose tangible actions.
\ee
