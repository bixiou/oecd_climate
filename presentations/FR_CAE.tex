%\item What are the \textcolor{magenta}{mental models} people use to think about tax policy?
%\bbs 
%\item What do they \textcolor{magenta}{know}? How do they \textcolor{magenta}{reason}? % We are interested in what people know, but not only. 
%\ee
%\item {\small $\text{Desired tax policy} = f(\text{perceived efficiency effects}, \text{perceived distributional impacts}, \text{fairness considerations}, X_1, X_2, ...)$} 
%\item Why is understanding reasoning important? 
%\bbs
%\item Advantages of a more structural approach to policy views, over reduced-form approach. 
%\item Heterogeneity (even if same overall policy view). Where does disagreement lie?
%\item Identifying (correctable) gaps in knowledge or inconsistent reasoning. 
%\item Where is intervention needed versus not (e.g.: misperception of distributional impacts vs. fairness concerns)?
%\item Can we improve the policy debate with better understanding of economic policies?
