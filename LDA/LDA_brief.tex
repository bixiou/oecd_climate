\section{Optimal Number of Profiles}
We assess the cohesion of models using the cohesion measure developed by \cite{draca2020polarized}. They use the Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) \citep{bouma2009normalized} (which captures the frequence at which two features appear together on a $[-1,1]$ scale). The NPMI are averaged over the $B$ most important positions of a profile. Finally the cohesion of a model is defined as the average of the overall NPMI of each profile.
As in \cite{lau2016sensitivity} the measure of cohesion is calculated for different number of features $B \in (5,10,15,20)$. Similarly to \cite{draca2020polarized}, the 4 type LDA specification performs best.

        \scalebox{0.7}{\input{"topic2.tex"}}
    \end{center}
    {\footnotesize Note: The dependent variables are indicator variables equal to one if the respondent has been assigned to this profile (generally because most of her responses belong to this profile). 
    The \textit{race: White only} indicator variable equals one if the respondent's self reported race is only ``White." The regression includes controls for gender, having children and not having completed a college degree. The three \textit{status} indicator variables indicate the difference in mean compared to a reference group of people not working (either unemployed or inactive). The \textit{status: Working} indicator variable includes respondents who self-reported being either ``Full-time employed", ``Part-time employed", or ``Self-employed". The three \textit{Income} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people in the first quartile of household's annual income in 2019 (i.e. income $<$ \textdollar 35,000). The five \textit{age} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people aged between 18 and 24. The two \textit{vote} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people who either did not vote in the 2020 Presidential election or voted for another candidate than Biden or Trump.
