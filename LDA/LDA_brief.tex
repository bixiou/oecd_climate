        \scalebox{0.7}{\input{"topic2.tex"}}
    \end{center}
    {\footnotesize Note: The dependent variables are indicator variables equal to one if the respondent has been assigned to this profile (generally because most of her responses belong to this profile). 
    The \textit{race: White only} indicator variable equals one if the respondent's self reported race is only ``White." The regression includes controls for gender, having children and not having completed a college degree. The three \textit{status} indicator variables indicate the difference in mean compared to a reference group of people not working (either unemployed or inactive). The \textit{status: Working} indicator variable includes respondents who self-reported being either ``Full-time employed", ``Part-time employed", or ``Self-employed". The three \textit{Income} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people in the first quartile of household's annual income in 2019 (i.e. income $<$ \textdollar 35,000). The five \textit{age} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people aged between 18 and 24. The two \textit{vote} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people who either did not vote in the 2020 Presidential election or voted for another candidate than Biden or Trump.
