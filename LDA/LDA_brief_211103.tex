    \textit{Yes; No}
    \item Q2. Should you win the lottery, please enter your donation amount using the slider below: \\
    \textit{Slide going from 0 to 100}
\end{itemize}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{h. International Burden-Sharing}
\end{flushleft}

    \item Q1. At which level(s) do you think public policies to tackle climate change need to be put in place? (Multiple answers are possible)  \\
    \textit{Global; European; National; Local}
    \item Q2. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: ``The UK should take measures to fight climate change.'' \\
    \textit{Strongly disagree; Somewhat disagree; Neither agree nor disagree; Somewhat agree; Strongly agree}
    \item Q3. How should UK climate policies depend on what other countries do?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If other countries do more, the UK should do… 
        \item If other countries do less, the UK should do…
    \end{itemize}
    \textit{Much less; Less; About the same; More; Much more}
    \item Q4. To achieve a given reduction of greenhouse gas emissions globally, costly investments are needed.
    Ideally, how should countries bear the costs of fighting climate change?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Countries should pay in proportion to their income
        \item Countries should pay in proportion to their current emissions
        \item Countries should pay in proportion to their past emissions (from 1990 onwards)
        \item The richest countries should pay it all, so that the poorest countries do not have to pay anything
        \item The richest countries should pay even more, to help vulnerable countries face adverse consequences: vulnerable countries would then receive money instead of paying
    \end{itemize}
    \textit{Strongly disagree; Somewhat disagree; Neither agree nor disagree; Somewhat agree; Strongly agree}
    \item Q5. Do you support or oppose establishing a global democratic assembly whose role would be to draft international treaties against climate change? Each adult across the world would have one vote to elect members of the assembly.  \\
    \textit{Strongly oppose; Somewhat oppose; Neither support nor oppose; Somewhat support; Strongly support}
    \item Q6. Imagine the following policy: a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions funding a global basic income.
    Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 8 cents per liter in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of \$30 (or £22) per month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than \$2/day out of extreme poverty.
    The average British person would lose a bit from this policy as they would face £42 per month in price increases, which is higher that the £22 they would receive. \\

    \textit{Strongly oppose; Somewhat oppose; Neither support nor oppose; Somewhat support; Strongly support}
    \item Q7. Do you support or oppose a tax on all millionaires around the world to finance low-income countries that comply with international standards regarding climate action?  \\

\section{Optimal Number of Profiles}
We assess the cohesion of models using the cohesion measure developed by \cite{draca2020polarized}. They use the Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) \citep{bouma2009normalized} (which captures the frequence at which two features appear together on a $[-1,1]$ scale). The NPMI are averaged over the $B$ most important positions of a profile. Finally the cohesion of a model is defined as the average of the overall NPMI of each profile.
As in \cite{lau2016sensitivity} the measure of cohesion is calculated for different number of features $B \in (5,10,15,20)$. Similarly to \cite{draca2020polarized}, the 4 type LDA specification performs best.

    \end{center}
    {\footnotesize Note: The dependent variables are indicator variables equal to one if the respondent has been assigned to this profile (generally because most of her responses belong to this profile). 
    The \textit{race: White only} indicator variable equals one if the respondent's self reported race is only ``White." The regression includes controls for gender, having children and not having completed a college degree. The three \textit{status} indicator variables indicate the difference in mean compared to a reference group of people not working (either unemployed or inactive). The \textit{status: Working} indicator variable includes respondents who self-reported being either ``Full-time employed", ``Part-time employed", or ``Self-employed". The three \textit{Income} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people in the first quartile of household's annual income in 2019 (i.e. income $<$ \textdollar 35,000). The five \textit{age} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people aged between 18 and 24. The two \textit{vote} indicator variables indicate difference in mean compared to a reference group of people who either did not vote in the 2020 Presidential election or voted for another candidate than Biden or Trump.
